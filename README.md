# PinEat
Simple app for converting recipes to PDF file.
This project was started from personal need :
I like to try different recipes, either cooking or baking, and I realized no ingredients and appliences work exactly the same as the original recipe, especially if the writer lives in different country.
I get these recipes from all over the internet, (youtube, blogs, instagram, books and etc) and it became hard to keep those difference sources with the comment I had of the recipe.
As a result I decided to build this program to do that all, to edit recipes for myself, to simplify layout design process, add notes if I had it and save it in a file so that I can print them out or view it on my ipad.
